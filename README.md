Web based pool and miner manager for Linux running CGminer and clones (sgminer, vertminer, keccak, etc). Written in perl (no php).
Originally extended from the BAMT miner web interface of gpumon/mgpumon.

* Add or Remove pools, or Switch priority, from the web GUI without stopping your miner.
* Stop/start the miner, with password protection and version/run time display.
* Stats header with Total Accepted/Rejected/Ratio, Work Util, HW errors, Uptime, Load, Free Mem.
* GPU and Pool details pages, including native graphing with persistence.
* Miner details page with reboot control, SSH to Host link and Configuration Editor.
* Install script enables SSL redirection (and optional default page password) for security.
* Easy CSS theming, with several themes included.
* GUI Settings Page - no need to edit a settings file
* Email alert notifications for GPUs and Pools, including hung or stopped miner.
* Strategy handling, Pool Aliases, Miner Profiles
* NEW! Password management from the GUI

See the GitHub wiki page for screenshots.

Reqirements: Linux running cgminer or clone. Built and tested on litecoin-bamt 1.2.
This should work out of the box on BAMT, but will need the following Perl modules on clean Linux installs:

* libjson-perl
* libyaml-perl
* librrds-perl
* libproc-pid-file-perl (reported)
* libproc-daemon-perl


and for email notifications..
* libemail-simple-perl
* libemail-sender-perl
* libtry-tiny-perl
* libemail-sender-transport-smtp-tls-perl (for TLS)

EASY PEASY SURE FIRE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS: (but see the above note!)

(Doing it this way ensures all the files will have the correct permissions.)

1. ssh into your miner, so you are at the command prompt. be root (if you are user, do: sudo su - ).
1. do: wget https://github.com/starlilyth/Linux-PoolManager/archive/master.zip
1. do: unzip master.zip
1. cd to 'Linux-PoolManager-master' directory and run: perl ./install-pm.pl

Please make sure the following entries are in your cgminer.conf:

    "api-listen" : true,
    "api-allow" : "W:127.0.0.1",

Once installed, simply visit the IP of your miner in a browser. PoolManager enables and uses SSL (https), so be sure to open port 443 on any firewalls or routers if necessary.

THAT IS ALL! STOP INSTALLING HERE UNLESS THINGS ARE BROKEN.

If you install htpasswd from the Settings page, the default login/password is poolmanager/live

UPGRADING IS JUST AS EASY!
  Do all the steps as above.

  NOTE! If you are upgrading from version 1.1 or 1.2 PLEASE NOTE: The poolmanager.conf has changed significantly. The easiest way to fix any issues is to rename your old poolmanager.conf (do: mv /opt/ifmi/poolmanager.conf /opt/ifmi/poolmanager.conf.old), then visit the settings page and let PoolManager create a new one.

Sudoers Note:
PoolManager installation attempts to modify /etc/sudoers to allow the web service to stop/start the miner application, modify files, and boot the machine, all as a specified user. This works on BAMT and most other distros. YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO EDIT SUDOERS 99% OF THE TIME. DONT DO IT UNLESS THINGS ARE BROKEN.
IF THE INSTALLER FAILS you will need to modify sudoers yourself with the following:

    apacheuser ALL=(root)NOPASSWD: /opt/ifmi/mcontrol
    Defaults:www-data rootpw
    apacheuser ALL=(root)/bin/cp

Where apacheuser is the user that your web service runs as.

If you wish to remove PoolManager, you can run the remove-pm.sh script in the same directory you ran install-pm.sh

EMAIL NOTES: You wont be able to use a non SSL/TLS configuration unless you install a local mail server. BAMT comes with no proper MTA, just 'esmtp' which is an outbound only SMTP connector to a real mail server (like Gmail). BAMT and true clones have the necessary modules to use this with a TLS connection, but NOT plain SSL.
Gmail works with port 587 and TLS.

FAQ:

Q1: I cant get to my miner page anymore!

A1: PoolManager changes your Apache configuration to use https, which is on port 443, not port 80. Please make sure you have port 443 open on any firewalls or routers between you and your miner.

Q3: How can I see my miner page/farmview remotely?

A3: In general, you will either have to allow access to your miner from the internet, or you can export the farmview.html page to an internet web server (probably with some combination of rsync/scp and cron). The specifics will depend on your setup and needs, and are beyond the scope of this document.

Q4: My graphs are messed up after updating.

A4: Press 'Clear All Graphs' on the settings page. It will take about ten minutes for the graphs to start redrawing.

Q5: How do I disable the default page password? I dont want it anymore.

A5: Edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl and comment out "Require valid-user", near the top. Then do 'apachectl restart'.

Q6: Why doesnt PoolManager let me: save a pool as X priority/switch to a dead pool/save priority list on restart?

A6: PoolManager only mirrors what cgminer can do, via the API, these are things that cgminer doesnt do, and are non-trivial to implement yet. As development progresses in some other areas, some of this may be easier, and I will add it.
